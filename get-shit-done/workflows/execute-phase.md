<purpose>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution. Orchestrator stays lean — delegates plan execution to subagents.
</purpose>

<core_principle>
Orchestrator coordinates, not executes. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context. Orchestrator: discover plans → analyze deps → group waves → spawn agents → handle checkpoints → collect results.
</core_principle>

<required_reading>
Read STATE.md before any operation to load project context.

<process>

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
Call the `gsd_init_execute_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{PHASE_ARG}" }`. Parse the returned JSON for: `executor_model`, `verifier_model`, `commit_docs`, `parallelization`, `branching_strategy`, `branch_name`, `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `phase_slug`, `plans`, `incomplete_plans`, `plan_count`, `incomplete_count`, `state_exists`, `roadmap_exists`.

**If `phase_found` is false:** Error — phase directory not found.
**If `plan_count` is 0:** Error — no plans found in phase.
**If `state_exists` is false but `.planning/` exists:** Offer reconstruct or continue.

When `parallelization` is false, plans within a wave execute sequentially.
</step>

<step name="handle_branching">
Check `branching_strategy` from init:

**"none":** Skip, continue on current branch.

**"phase" or "milestone":** Use pre-computed `branch_name` from init:
```bash
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME" 2>/dev/null || git checkout "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

All subsequent commits go to this branch. User handles merging.

<step name="validate_phase">
From init JSON: `phase_dir`, `plan_count`, `incomplete_count`.

Call the `gsd_get_phase_plan` tool with `{ "phase": "{PHASE_NUMBER}" }`. Parse the returned JSON for: `phase`, `plans[]` (each with `id`, `wave`, `autonomous`, `objective`, `files_modified`, `task_count`, `has_summary`), `waves` (map of wave number → plan IDs), `incomplete`, `has_checkpoints`.

**Filtering:** Skip plans where `has_summary: true`. If `--gaps-only`: also skip non-gap_closure plans. If all filtered: "No matching incomplete plans" → exit.

## Execution Plan

**Phase {X}: {Name}** — {total_plans} plans across {wave_count} waves

| Wave | Plans | What it builds |
|------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | 01-01, 01-02 | {from plan objectives, 3-8 words} |
| 2 | 01-03 | ... |
```
</step>

<step name="execute_waves">
Execute each wave in sequence. Within a wave: parallel if `PARALLELIZATION=true`, sequential if `false`.

**For each wave:**

1. **Describe what's being built (BEFORE spawning):**

   Read each plan's `<objective>`. Extract what's being built and why.

   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N}

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {2-3 sentences: what this builds, technical approach, why it matters}

   Spawning {count} agent(s)...
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Executing terrain generation plan"
   - Good: "Procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise — creates height maps, biome zones, and collision meshes. Required before vehicle physics can interact with ground."

2. **Spawn executor agents:**

   Pass paths only — executors read files themselves with their fresh 200k context.
   This keeps orchestrator context lean (~10-15%).

   ```
   <delegate>
     <agent type="gsd-executor" model="{executor_model}">Execute plan {plan_number} of phase {phase_number}-{phase_name}</agent>
     <prompt>
       <objective>
       Execute plan {plan_number} of phase {phase_number}-{phase_name}.
       Commit each task atomically. Create SUMMARY.md. Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md.
       </objective>

       <execution_context>
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-plan.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/summary.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/checkpoints.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md
       </execution_context>

       <files_to_read>
       Read these files at execution start using the Read tool:
       - Plan: {phase_dir}/{plan_file}
       - State: .planning/STATE.md
       - Config: .planning/config.json (if exists)
       </files_to_read>

       <success_criteria>
       - [ ] All tasks executed
       - [ ] Each task committed individually
       - [ ] SUMMARY.md created in plan directory
       - [ ] STATE.md updated with position and decisions
       - [ ] ROADMAP.md updated with plan progress (via `gsd_roadmap_update_plan_progress` tool)
       </success_criteria>
     </prompt>
   </delegate>
   ```

3. **Wait for all agents in wave to complete.**

4. **Report completion — spot-check claims first:**

   For each SUMMARY.md:
   - Verify first 2 files from `key-files.created` exist on disk
   - Check `git log --oneline --all --grep="{phase}-{plan}"` returns ≥1 commit
   - Check for `## Self-Check: FAILED` marker

   If ANY spot-check fails: report which plan failed, route to failure handler — ask "Retry plan?" or "Continue with remaining waves?"

   If pass:
   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N} Complete

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {What was built — from SUMMARY.md}
   {Notable deviations, if any}

   {If more waves: what this enables for next wave}
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Wave 2 complete. Proceeding to Wave 3."
   - Good: "Terrain system complete — 3 biome types, height-based texturing, physics collision meshes. Vehicle physics (Wave 3) can now reference ground surfaces."

5. **Handle failures:**

   For real failures: report which plan failed → ask "Continue?" or "Stop?" → if continue, dependent plans may also fail. If stop, partial completion report.

6. **Execute checkpoint plans between waves** — see `<checkpoint_handling>`.

7. **Proceed to next wave.**
</step>

<step name="checkpoint_handling">
Plans with `autonomous: false` require user interaction.

**Auto-mode checkpoint handling:**

Call the `gsd_config_get` tool with `{ "key": "workflow.auto_advance" }`. Use the returned value as `AUTO_CFG`.

When executor returns a checkpoint AND `AUTO_CFG` is `"true"`:
- **human-verify** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = `"approved"`. Log `⚡ Auto-approved checkpoint`.
- **decision** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = first option from checkpoint details. Log `⚡ Auto-selected: [option]`.
- **human-action** → Present to user (existing behavior below). Auth gates cannot be automated.

**Standard flow (not auto-mode, or human-action type):**

1. Spawn agent for checkpoint plan
2. Agent runs until checkpoint task or auth gate → returns structured state
3. Agent return includes: completed tasks table, current task + blocker, checkpoint type/details, what's awaited
4. **Present to user:**
   ```
   ## Checkpoint: [Type]

   **Plan:** 03-03 Dashboard Layout
   **Progress:** 2/3 tasks complete

   [Checkpoint Details from agent return]
   [Awaiting section from agent return]
   ```
5. User responds: "approved"/"done" | issue description | decision selection
6. **Spawn continuation agent (NOT resume)** using continuation-prompt.md template:
   - `{completed_tasks_table}`: From checkpoint return
   - `{resume_task_number}` + `{resume_task_name}`: Current task
   - `{user_response}`: What user provided
   - `{resume_instructions}`: Based on checkpoint type
7. Continuation agent verifies previous commits, continues from resume point
8. Repeat until plan completes or user stops

**Why fresh agent, not resume:** Resume relies on internal serialization that breaks with parallel tool calls. Fresh agents with explicit state are more reliable.

**Checkpoints in parallel waves:** Agent pauses and returns while other parallel agents may complete. Present checkpoint, spawn continuation, wait for all before next wave.

```
</step>

<step name="close_parent_artifacts">
**For decimal/polish phases only (X.Y pattern):** Close the feedback loop by resolving parent UAT and debug artifacts.

**Skip if** phase number has no decimal (e.g., `3`, `04`) — only applies to gap-closure phases like `4.1`, `03.1`.

**1. Detect decimal phase and derive parent:**
```bash
# Check if phase_number contains a decimal
if [[ "$PHASE_NUMBER" == *.* ]]; then
  PARENT_PHASE="${PHASE_NUMBER%%.*}"
fi
```

**2. Find parent UAT file:**

Call the `gsd_find_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{PARENT_PHASE}" }`. Extract directory from the returned JSON, then find the UAT file in that directory.

**If no parent UAT found:** Skip this step (gap-closure may have been triggered by VERIFICATION.md instead).

**3. Update UAT gap statuses:**

Read the parent UAT file's `## Gaps` section. For each gap entry with `status: failed`:
- Update to `status: resolved`

**4. Update UAT frontmatter:**

If all gaps now have `status: resolved`:
- Update frontmatter `status: diagnosed` → `status: resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp

**5. Resolve referenced debug sessions:**

For each gap that has a `debug_session:` field:
- Read the debug session file
- Update frontmatter `status:` → `resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp
- Move to resolved directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/debug/resolved
mv .planning/debug/{slug}.md .planning/debug/resolved/
```

**6. Commit updated artifacts:**

Call the `gsd_commit_work` tool with `{ "message": "docs(phase-${PARENT_PHASE}): resolve UAT gaps and debug sessions after ${PHASE_NUMBER} gap closure", "files": ".planning/phases/*${PARENT_PHASE}*/*-UAT.md .planning/debug/resolved/*.md" }`.
</step>

<step name="verify_phase_goal">
Verify phase achieved its GOAL, not just completed tasks.

Call the `gsd_roadmap_get_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{PHASE_NUMBER}" }`. Extract `section` from the result and parse `Requirements:` IDs.

```
<delegate>
  <agent type="gsd-verifier" model="{verifier_model}">Verify Phase {phase_number} goal achievement</agent>
  <prompt>
    Verify phase {phase_number} goal achievement.
    Phase directory: {phase_dir}
    Phase goal: {goal from ROADMAP.md}
    Phase requirement IDs: {phase_req_ids}
    Check must_haves against actual codebase.
    Cross-reference requirement IDs from PLAN frontmatter against REQUIREMENTS.md — every ID MUST be accounted for.
    Create VERIFICATION.md.
  </prompt>
</delegate>
```

Read status:
```bash
grep "^status:" "$PHASE_DIR"/*-VERIFICATION.md | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' '
```

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `passed` | → update_roadmap |
| `human_needed` | Present items for human testing, get approval or feedback |
| `gaps_found` | Present gap summary, offer `gsd_plan_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{X}", "gaps": "true" }` |

**If human_needed:**
```
## ✓ Phase {X}: {Name} — Human Verification Required

All automated checks passed. {N} items need human testing:

{From VERIFICATION.md human_verification section}

"approved" → continue | Report issues → gap closure
```

**If gaps_found:**
```
## ⚠ Phase {X}: {Name} — Gaps Found

**Score:** {N}/{M} must-haves verified
**Report:** {phase_dir}/{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md

### What's Missing
{Gap summaries from VERIFICATION.md}

## ▶ Next Up

Call the `gsd_plan_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{X}", "gaps": "true" }`

<sub>Start a fresh conversation for best results</sub>

Also: `cat {phase_dir}/{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md` — full report
Also: Call the `gsd_verify_work` tool with `{ "phase": "{X}" }` — manual testing first
```

Gap closure cycle: Call the `gsd_plan_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{X}", "gaps": "true" }` — reads VERIFICATION.md → creates gap plans with `gap_closure: true` → user calls the `gsd_execute_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{X}", "gaps": "true" }` → verifier re-runs.
</step>

<step name="update_roadmap">
**Mark phase complete and update all tracking files:**

Call the `gsd_complete_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{PHASE_NUMBER}" }`.

The tool handles:
- Marking phase checkbox `[x]` with completion date
- Updating Progress table (Status → Complete, date)
- Updating plan count to final
- Advancing STATE.md to next phase
- Updating REQUIREMENTS.md traceability

Extract from result: `next_phase`, `next_phase_name`, `is_last_phase`.

Call the `gsd_commit_work` tool with `{ "message": "docs(phase-{X}): complete phase execution", "files": ".planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md .planning/phases/{phase_dir}/*-VERIFICATION.md" }`.
</step>

<step name="offer_next">

**Exception:** If `gaps_found`, the `verify_phase_goal` step already presents the gap-closure path (call the `gsd_plan_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{X}", "gaps": "true" }`). No additional routing needed — skip auto-advance.

**Auto-advance detection:**

1. Check for `"auto": "true"` in the `<arguments>` JSON block above
2. Call the `gsd_config_get` tool with `{ "key": "workflow.auto_advance" }`. Use the returned value as `AUTO_CFG`.

**If `"auto": "true"` is present in arguments OR `AUTO_CFG` is true (AND verification passed with no gaps):**

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  AUTO-ADVANCING → TRANSITION             ║
║  Phase {X} verified, continuing chain    ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Execute the transition workflow inline (do NOT use delegate — orchestrator context is ~10-15%, transition needs phase completion data already in context):

Read and follow `~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/transition.md`, passing through the `"auto": "true"` argument so it propagates to the next phase invocation.

**If neither `"auto"` argument nor `AUTO_CFG` is true:**

The workflow ends. The user calls the `gsd_progress` tool or invokes the transition workflow manually.
</step>

</process>

<context_efficiency>
Orchestrator: ~10-15% context. Subagents: fresh 200k each. No polling (Task blocks). No context bleed.
</context_efficiency>

<failure_handling>
- **Agent fails mid-plan:** Missing SUMMARY.md → report, ask user how to proceed
- **Dependency chain breaks:** Wave 1 fails → Wave 2 dependents likely fail → user chooses attempt or skip
- **All agents in wave fail:** Systemic issue → stop, report for investigation
- **Checkpoint unresolvable:** "Skip this plan?" or "Abort phase execution?" → record partial progress in STATE.md
</failure_handling>

<resumption>
Re-run the `gsd_execute_phase` tool with `{ "phase": "{phase}" }` → discover_plans finds completed SUMMARYs → skips them → resumes from first incomplete plan → continues wave execution.

STATE.md tracks: last completed plan, current wave, pending checkpoints.
